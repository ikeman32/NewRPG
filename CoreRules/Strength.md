**Strength Checks**
When doing a strength check to determine if a character is successful or not consult the strength table above, then using the character’s strength score find the appropriate column to the right of the strength score. The weights list are the minimum weights for that column add the appropriate modifier to the character’s strength score and that is the minimum roll required to pass a strength check.

Example 1: A character is attempting to force open a heavy door that weighs 230 lbs. There are no other factors to overcome just the weight of the door.  The character’s strength score is 5 and the weight of the door places the difficulty in the hard column so the Game Master adds a plus 3 modifier to the character’s strength score making it 8. That means that a character must roll an 8 or higher in order to force open the door.

**Additional Modifiers to Strength Checks**
In some cases a character may attempt to do something well beyond their physical ability to perform, but the same feat is much easier for a much stronger character and a simple plus 3 modifier just will not do. In this case from the character’s hard + 3 column move down line by line until the weight listed is at or below the weight the character is attempting to overcome counting each line as you go. Next at the number counted to the already modified strength score. This result is the new minimum the character must roll for a successful strength check.

Example 2: Let’s say the same character from the first example now must force open a heavier door that is 425lbs which is far beyond the character’s physical ability.  The Game Master consults the table from the hard column and counts down line by line until he/she reaches 414, the count is 4. The GM then adds the 4 to the already modified score of 8 and the new total is 12. That means the character must roll a perfect 12 in order to force open the door.

**Group Efforts**
In some instances a single character simply can’t do it alone, this happens when the modified strength score is beyond 12. In this case the weight of the feat is divided by the number of characters making the attempt simultaneously rounded to the nearest whole number. Then the strength check is done using the strongest character’s modified strength score.

Example 3: For a third time a much heavier door is encountered that weighs 1,000 lbs. Since the character can not possibly budge the door he enlists he help of the others with him. Together there are 5 people trying to move the door. Each character only has to move 200 lbs a fairly easy task relatively speaking. The strongest among them has a strength score of 7 and his modified score is only 8.

**Group Effort Benefit**
There is one additional benefit to a group effort that does not occur with a single character strength check. If the strength check fails on the die roll the roll itself is modified by plus one for each member involved in the group effort. 

Example 3 cont: Let’s say the strength check roll is a 4, ordinarily that would be an automatic failure but since this is a group effort the roll is modified by + 5. One for each member in the effort making the modified roll a 9 thus the group successfully opens the door.

**Multiple Attempts**
If a character fails their strength check or a group effort fails their strength check even with a modified die roll a number of attempts may be made in addition to the original attempt. The number of attempts depend upon which original strength modifier is used. If the hard modifier was used only 1 do over is allowed, 2 for medium and 3 for easy.  If a character is attempting to move something beyond their physical ability they can not make more than one attempt.

Optional Rule: After a character exhausts all of their attempts they must wait on half hour per attempt that they made before making one final attempt after which no further attempts may be made.
