**Combat**

If the  to hit is lower than the defence then the to hit is equal to the defence score of the target or better with 3 D 6. 
IF the to hit is higher than the defence score of the targt then the to hit is equal to the defence minus the difference.

**Example 1**:

To hit = 11
Enemy Def = 13
Must roll 13 or better to hit.

**Example 2**:

To hit = 11
Enemy Def = 10

To hit = 10 - 1 or at least 9 or better to hit.
