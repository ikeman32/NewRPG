  # Money
The basic monetary unit is the Interstellar Credit or IC, and is based on power production in watts so 1 watt equals 1 IC. It is the only medium of exchange in interstellar space and all transactions are done electronically, there is no physical exchange of currency. However, credits are typically stored either in an electronic wallet carried with the individual called a chit, or the Interstellar Bank Consortium. The monetary system works similar to the crypto currencies of today.

**Exchange Rate**

Since some cultures may still have their own monetary system when they travel off world and venture into interstellar space they will need to purchase IC’s in order to buy the things they need, food, shelter etc.  The basic exchange rate is based upon the average cost of a Kilowatt Hour at 12 cents in US Dollars.  So one USD will purchase 8 IC, the actual amount is 8.3333 IC but there is no unit smaller than 1 IC so the number is rounded to 8 IC.

**Medium of Exchange**

There are not actual physical interstellar credit currencies in existence all exchanges of credits are through electronic means. These transfers are typically done via biological verification, thumb prints, retina scans, etc. But encrypted chips about the size of a common credit card on Earth are sometimes used. These chips work much like a prepaid debit card and contain encrypted information that is encoded by a Banking Machine similar to an ATM. They are commonly used when a transaction is needing more privacy or between two individuals where a Banking Machine is not available.

EC (Encrypted Chips) can be used to transfer IC’s from one EC to the other, can be inserted into a merchant payment machine, can be physically transferred to another owner, etc. They do not contain any personal information and are convenient way to keep IC’s with on one’s own person for emergencies or just general every day spending. It is private and keeps transactions from flooding the Interstellar Banking Consortium with personal transactions. Also it provides a way for those not able to get an account with the IBC.

**Interstellar Banking Consortium**

The IBC, is the central bank of the interstellar community and is primarily responsible for the vast Interstellar Banking Network Communications. All banks are locally owned and operated but maintain a membership with the IBC and pay annual dues which goes to maintain the IBNC (Interstellar Banking Network Communications) as well as taking a small one percent cut from every merchant transaction.
