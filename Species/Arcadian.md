**History**: The Arcadians were once a war like society with a strick Imperial Caste system of governance but despite the restrictive caste system of the time women and men held equal status within their prospective caste. Yes there were even womn warriors within the caste system as it was their birth right, but while there was  warrior caste every Arcadian was expcted to learn how to fight and serve in the military, even women. Those that showed promise and were able to prove themselves were often elevated to the warrior caste. An Arcadian's caste did not depend upon their family's caste so much as their parent's caste, while a particular family might generally be in the Artisan's caste individual members of a family might be members of a different caste such as the warrior caste. Marrying outside your caste was forbidden and could lead to death for both parties, sometimes whole families. But earning an assention into a higher caste was possible on an individual basis and eaned that person's family prestige and honor. 

But 2,000 years ago when the Arcadians were at the height of their power and had made over a dozen conquests, they met their match; however, when they invaded an ally of the Tritosian Empire, the Vegan's. The Vegan's have no military to speak of as they are a peaceful race and do not believe in war, but despite this pasifistic nature they are not above calling upon friends in times of danger. And call upon friends they did, within hours of recieving the distress call from Vega the 18th Tritosian Battle Fleet deployed without orders from Tritosian Millitary Command to defend the Vegan System from attack, but those orders did arrive enroute to Vega to which a reply was sent, "Orders acknowledge, already enroute. Enemy engagement eminent."

The 18th Fleet quickly beat back the Arcadians forcing them to retreat to Arcadian space and liberating the Vegan system in the at the same time. The Arcadian Emperor quickly realized his mistake when the Tritosian Empire began their assault on the Arcadian outposts closest to the Arcadian Home World and punched through the defenses like a hot knife through butter and were quickly knocking at their front door demanding the Arcadian Empire to surrender. There was a small counter attack launchd by fanatical units of the ADF (Arcadian Defense Force) a purely defensive section of the overall Military of Arcadia. But by this time the 18th Fleet had recieve reinforcements from the 9th Fleet and the ADF was wiped out.

Having no choice the Emperor surrendered unconditionally to the commander of the 18th Fleet. A month later the Treaty of Vega was signed and implemented which prohibited the Arcadians from deploying millitary forces beyond Arcadian Space for military action except when they are being invaded by another species and have declared war against the same; are defending allies from invasion; defending or escorting Arcadian merchant vessels or dignitaries; responding to a planetary distress call out side the Empire; have been requested to provide millitary aid by another star system; etc.

Within 100 years of the signing of the Treaty of Vega the caste system collapsed and a civil war lasting nearly a century ensued but the Vegans with the help of the Tritosians played an instrumental role is ending the Arcadian Civil War. And helped the Arcadians to install a new government with the Emperor has head of state and thus the Reformation period began leading to the Arcadian Declaration of Rights which gave all Arcadians equal rights under the law.

**Physical Characteristics**: Arcadians are tall and muscular having a dark brownish tone to their skin which is extremely tough do to their metalic biochemistry able to resist projectile weapons and energy based weapons. Females are comparable in hight to the males as well as strength but there are obvious feminine characteristics in their appearance.

**Biology**: Arcadians reproduce in the same manner as many species with a binary mating pair; however, the mechanics are slighly different in that there is no genital thrusting only a union which lasts upto an hour and leaves both partners exausted. Once the union occurs it is impossible and dangerous to stop. Arcadian females are considered one of the most beautiful and desirable of all humanoid species but also the most dangerous to mate with because of the impossibility to halt the mating once it begins. 

Females have been known to mate with other species and even bare hybrid offspring but these hybrids are rare as biological compatibility is an issue. But male Arcadians never mate outside of their own species because they don't know the mechanics of other species mating. Females also have a natural means of birth control while nowhere near as sophisticated as Tritosian females, they have a muscle in their cervix that they can consciously control to prevent sperm from entering the reporductive system. Although if open they have about the same chances of pregnancy as a human female. 

If a female opens the muscle it is called opening her womb and considered an honor, but typically this is only done for her life mate. However, it is not unheard of for a female to open her womb for a male that she deems worthy.

**Origin**: The Arcadian species originated on the their home world of Arcadia Prime through an evolutionary process but other than that not much else is known.

**Culture**: Arcadians have a deep sense of honor but while there is no formal code of honor there is an unwritten code that all Arcadians follow and won't hesitate to ostricize another Arcadian for violating that unwritten code. While no longer war-like all Arcadians ar formitable fighters and won't back down from a challenge or run from a fight. But despite this they are generally friendly and easy to get along with so long as you don't mince words with them. They perfer to be direct and to the point in all things even when looking for a mate. 

For this reason and because women out number men in Arcadian society all one has to do to find a mate is to straight up ask an Arcadian female if she wants to mate. If she says yes then nature will take its course. If she says no; however, males of other species had better learn to accept that she means no and refusal to accept no for an answer will have dire consequences. Females respect honor and courage more than physical strength so it would not be out of character for an Arcadian female to be seen with a male that appears to be weak.

Sexuality is very different in Arcadian culture and while they never mate in public or are lude, it is not uncommon to see bare chested Arcadians of either gender within or without of the Empire, unless local law prohibits it. Public nudity is also acceptable but only pregnant women are allowed this privilege and is a common tradition widely practice within the Empire.

Arcadians do marry but when they do it is for life, there is no such thing as a divorce and no word for it in the Arcadian language. There are two ways to be married under Arcadian tradition and law. The first is a simple ceremony that is legally binding and the other is through a less common practice called the three fold law. The three fold law states that any female that willingly mates with a male with her womb open three times and the male is aware of this fact, then upon the third mating they are life mates. But in order for this to be legally binding the female must state that her womb is open for the male she is mating with, the act of mating is considered consent on the male's part. 

**Special or Unique Abilities**: Arcadians recieve only 1/3 damage from bladed weapons and 1/2 damage from projectile weapons.
