**History**: The history of the Seculoid species is one bloody infestation after another, their presence on an in habited world is the baned of the known galaxy. When every they are encountered they are exterminated with extreme prejudice. It is the only known species that is universally hated by every known civilization. This species is so hated that even the Tritosians responded to a planetary distress call within Galarian controlled space with such overwhelming force that the infestation had been eradicated before the Galarian Military Force could be called upon to wipe out the threat. That event which took place on Eldinaris 6 directly led to the Non-agression Treaty of Eldinaris between the two rivals.

**Physical Characteristics**: Though the physical appearance varies depending upon the function of the particular Seculoid they closely resemble a 7 foot cockroach with masive strength. As such will always have a 12 strength score. There are several types of Seculoid starting with the Queen who is jet black and eternally pregnant, her sole function is to mate and lay eggs. She is attended by three Purplish Black females called successors, one of whom will take the queen's place if she dies or it is percieved to be weak in some way. The other seculoids are identified by their color listed as follows:

- Blue: Fertile males used specifically for breeding with the queen. A typical blue will mate two or three times before being killed and devoured by the successors.
- Red: These are the hive worker drones and the defenders of the incubation and inner chambers that houses the queen and the young. 
- Green: Foot soldiers that are the first to emerge from the hive and bring back reources to grow the colonie.
- Brown: These seculoids are fliers and are used for reconnisance and aerial attacks.
- Yellow: These are the heavy infantry of the seculoid colonies.
- White: There is only ever one of these and the appearance of one means that the hive is preparing to leave the planet to find another place to infest.

**Biology**: While there is a male to female pairing for reproductive purposes the majority of seculoids are generless.

**Origin**: The origins of the Seculoid species is unknown and nobody knows for sure which part of the galaxy they started out from. All that is known for sure is that they possess some sort of biotechnology that somehow gives them a crude form of spaceflight and is operated by a single White Seculoid that ends up as the Queen's first meal once they make planet fall.

**Culture**: Seculoids destroy whatever ecosystem they infest and are driven solely by the needs of the hive. They are fearless and relentless consuming everything in their path. Once a planet as been exploited of all its useful resources a White Seculoid emerges and begins construction of their interstellar vessel that is a living thing from the moment it is launched. Know one knows for sure how this vessel works or even how it is launched into space but it is speculated that it gets its power from solar light and solar winds. What everyone does agree on is that the White Seculoid is the key to the vessel and is the only one that knows the secret to its construction and operation. Killing this seculoid the moment it appears is paramount to preventing a new infestation elsewhere in the galaxy, that and killing the queen and her three succesors.

**Special or Unique Abilities**: Naturally hard body armor that can absorb 50 points of damage from energy based weapons and 80 points of damage from projectile based weapons.

**Strengths and Weaknesses**: Seculoids are incredibly strong and agile creatures their strength is always a 12 and their dexterity is also a 12. Depending on their color their stamina will vary.

- Black: The queen stamina is 7 but her succesors are a 12.
- Blue: 5
- Red: 9
- Green: 10
- Brown: 9
- Yellow: 12
- White: 12

Seculoid intelligence is very low except for the White which has a high intelligence of 10. All other seculoids are 4 and below on intellignce, the queen and her three succesors being the most intelligent within the hive until the emergence of the White Seculoid.
