**History**: It is thougt by Humans at least that these people are responsible for the Artherean legends of Avalon but no one knows for sure as their history is shrouded in mystery and legend.

**Physical Characteristics**: Avalonians are shape shifters and can appear in any form they wish no one knows if they have a natural form or not.

**Biology**: The Avalon species is a complete mystery to the rest of the interstellar community it is not known how they reproduce the only thing that is known for sure is thei biological immortality.

**Origin**: Unknown

**Culture**: Little is known about Avalonian culture except that they are 100% pacifists and do not take sides in any conflict for any reason whatsoever. If threatened they will simply leave appearing to vanish into thin air. But the Avalonian ability to heal is second to none, they are even the envy of the Tritosian Medical Corps which prides itself on the advancement of medicine and medical technology. However, the Avalonians appear to need very little technology to diagnose and heal medical problems. In fact they seem to be able to heal without the use of any materials whatsoever. Witnesses claim to have no memory of an Avalonian posessing or using any sort of technology or how they even arrived in the first place.

**Special or Unique Abilities**:
- Shape shifting: Avalonians can appear in any form they wish and typically appear as a member of a species they are trying to help
- Natural healing: The ability to heal by laying on of hands is an innate abilty no unique to Avalonians but their skill in this area is second to none. With this abiltiy they can seal wounds, stop bleeding, cure disease, etc. This skill increases with the age of an Avalonian, the older they are the more serious of wounds and disease they can cure.
- Telepathy: Avalonians can communicate with each other through telepathy and can to some degree do the same with other sentient beings to make them feel at ease. But they are quite capable of speaking as well.
- Unknown abilities: There are rumored abilities that the Avalonians possess but nothing that has been confirmed. Much is just speculation and legend but one ability seems to be prevalent is the apparent ability to vanish in an instant if threatened. But how they do this is a subject of much debate and speculation.

**Strengths and Weaknesses**: Avalonians are immune to all forms of disease and aging, thus they are biologically immortal. But asside from that nothing else is known about them. Since they are shape shifters it is assumed that they can take on the characteristics and attributes of whatever being or creature they take on assuming their strengths an weaknesses, but this is conjecture.
