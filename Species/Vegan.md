**Physical Characteristics**:

**Biology**: While there are clearly male and female Vegans either gender is capable of bearing children as the Vegans are marsupial in nature. Anatomically the male and female reproductive organs are the same as that of a typical human and the female is the one to concieve and gestate the young in the beginning stages. It is typically the male that will carry the young to term in a pouch located on their abdomen, but this is not always the case especially with a reletively young female having her first child.

**Origin**:

**Culture**: Vegans are a very sexual species prefering to mate as a means to settle conflict over fighing, they also have no clothing to speak of prefering to be au natural. For this reason they are very rarely seen outside of the Vega system and even when they are they will only don the least restrictive clothing possible. Vegans are not shy about their sexuality either and will mate in public unless there children below the minimum age present. There are zones all across Vega 4 where public mating is prohibited for this reason.

Vegan females will mate with any humanoid species no mater how repulsive they look as it is not the looks that mater but the physical act of mating that is important. A Vegan female will begin mating at the age of 20 and not one day before, her first experience is usually with a trusted friend who then shares her with another trusted friend. From that point on she will mate daily with no less than two partners for the rest of her life. Every 10th year of a Vegan female's adult life (20 and up) she will become fertile and will seek out up to 15 mating partners in a single day in order to concieve. Conception parties are common in Vegan society when a female become fertile. The concept of monogomy and marriage is alien to a Vegan, but it's not unusual for a mating pair to occur for short periods of time ( 2 to 3 days tops). Once a female concieves the young will gestate for 8 weeks before emerging from the vulva. The emergence of the youngling is always a public event that is quite the spectacle and unless it is her first time there will be a plethora of males volunteering to bear the youngly to full term. First timers are expected to bear their own young to term.

Males begin their mating life at a much younger age around 14 or 15 and their first experience is always a teacher whoes sole perpose is to teach them how to please a mate. But despite their young beginnings male Vegans are not fertile until they reach 20 years and like the females will mate with any humanoid species regardless of they physical appearance.
