# New Species Guide Lines

**Species Name**: 

This refers to the common name of the species, Human, Arcadian, etc.

**Bio Chemistry**: 

This is the basis for life Humans are carbon based for instance. For now here are the basic bio chemistry make ups:

- Carbon
- Silicon
- Borane
- Metalic
- Sulfur
- Energy: Not sure if this is an appropriate classification as yet.


**Life Form Type**:

This refers to the general appearance of the life form the basic types:

- Humanoid
- Avian
- Reptilian
- Insectoid
- Gasious
- Energy: As with the Bio Chemistry not exactly sure if this is the appropriate classification.

**Life Span**:

Pretty self explanitory, how long the species typically lives assuming that it lives to a ripe old age and then dies of natural causes measured in years. There is currently only one species ([Avalonian](https://github.com/ikeman32/NewRPG/blob/master/Species/Avalonian.md)) that is biologically immortal which is to say that it will never die from old age. Conversely there is another species ([Tritosian](https://github.com/ikeman32/NewRPG/blob/master/Species/Tritosian.md)) that's life span is unknown as there has never been a recorded death by natural causes, i.e. old age.

**Social Organization**:

This refers to the general additude and rolls of the species genders, there are currently four classifications:

- Matriarchy: Female dominated society
- Patriarcy: Male dominated society
- Egalitarian: No specific gender is dominant
- Solitary: Almost neve seen together each being lives a solitary life unless they have offspring but said offspring is left to its own devices after a certain age.

**Genders**:

This atribute description refers to biological reproduction only and not any sort of self identity that a player would want their character to be. When creating a character a player may certainly want to have their character to self identify as a certain gender if that is their preference. If that is the case they may want to look at the current [Species List](https://github.com/ikeman32/NewRPG/blob/master/Species/Species%20List.md) that closely mataches the gender identity of their character or create one of their own, but if they simply want their character to identify as a specific gender there is no rule, nor should there be, to prevent it. Current classifications are:

- Binary: Requiring to genders typically male and female to mate and reproduce.

- Asexual: An asexual species does not require a mate and will typically just reproduce at a given time in its life span.

- Other: This is just a general classification for when nothing specific applies.

**Diet**:

Basically what do they eat? At present diets are as follows:

- Omnivore: Eats meats and vegetable matter.

- Carnivore: Eats only meat.

- Vegetarian: Eats only vegetable matter, i.e. plants.

- Other: A general classification for other types of diets not yet specifically classified

**Religion Type**:

This specifically is a cultural atribute and does not depict or ascribe to a particular religion or doctrine. Types are:

- Monothesic: Having only one deity.

- Polythesic: Having more than one deity.

- Atheist: Having no deity or religion.

- Variable: This is for societies that may have more than one type of religion in their culture like humans do, they have Monthesic, Polythesic, Atheist, etc.

**Government Type**:

Refers to the type of governance. Classifications are:

- Monarchy: Ruled by a king, queen or some other specific title.

- Parlimentary Monarchy: Think UK

- Imperial: Ruled by an Emperor or Emperess or some other specfic title.

- Parlimentary Imperial: Think Japan

- Fudal: Ruled by a central monarch with other nobles acting as lords over certain regions.

**Home World**:

This is the species planet of origin where there species first appeared, for humans their home world is Earth.

**Colonies**:

This refers to the number of establish planetary colonies or military conquests by the species and does not include their home world.
