**History**: Galarians have been the Galaxy's mot prolific empire expanding through conquest and prospering through slavery of the conquered, that was until their creations the Tritosians successfully rebelled and won their freedom. Since that time their conquests have been few and far between but, their expansion has come to a halt after the Seculoid incident on one of their outer vassal world and the Tritosians were the ones to respond. The incident shamed the mighty millitary empire forcing the Emperess to acknowledge the freedom and independence of their former slaves once and for all.

**Physical Characteristics**: Galarians are semi-shapeshifters and thus are able to change their physical appearance to appear to be a different humanoid species or gender but can not change their size or mass. The most commonly change their appearance so as to look more esthetically appealing as their true appearance is grotesque (think toxic avenger).

**Biology**: Galarians mate in the usual way that a binary species does, but the female is the agressor and head of household, males are totally subservient to the females. All officers or persons of leadership are female and even though the women bear the young it is the males that rear them. 

**Origin**: The home system of the Galarians is a Trinary Star System and their home world of Galaria Prime is a heavy gravity planet of nearly 2 G-forces so they are naturally strong having a minimum strength of 6 roll 1d6 and add 5 for an initial strength score. According to legend the first Galarian to emerge from the lake of eternal life was the Emperess Aleen who then commanded her people to rise from the lake. But this legend is largely discounted as a fairy tale amongst the ruling elite and spreading the legend is punishable by death.

**Culture**: Galarians are Strictly Matriarcal Society, all positions of leadership are held by women without exception and any male asserting independence or dominance is quickly killed. There are males within the massive millitary but they are largely canon fodder and support staff for the women. The only thing subservient to a Galarian male are the slaves and they are often victims of great abuse by their male masters. Galarians view any non-Galarian species as beneath them unless their Emperess decrees them otherwise. Despite this belief they are remarkably well behaved when seen outside the Empire and will even socialize with other species even though they might personally despise them. 

Outside the Empire Galarians most often appear as a male humanoid of an undeterminate species that is very plain in appearance, but actual male Galarians outside the Empire are rare. There are; however, Galarians that have escaped the Empire and defected to the Tritosian Empire, but they usually form a small community amongst themselves. And even though under Tritosian law males are equal, within the community the women still rule the roost, but male independence is tolerated.

**Special or Unique Abilities**: Asside from their ability to change their appearance and natural strength there is nothing remarkable about Galarians unless you count their natural hideous looks.

**Strengths and Weaknesses**: Once a Galarian changes their physical appearance they can hold it indefinitely without any effort until they are rendered unconscious and then they revert back to their natural appearance. Their strength is a minimum of six 1d6 plus 5 but their other attributes are all average anddetermined the usual way; however, an intelligence of less than 5 is always a male but an intelligence of 6 or greater is always female.
