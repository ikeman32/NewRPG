The mental disciplines is the Tri Tosian term for psionics, while not specifically confined to the Tri Tosian species, they are the only known species wih a school dedicated to the mental disciplines. They are also the only known species that have a strict code of ethics for the use of certain disciplines known as the Code of Thankar named for the school's founder. While the code does cover all of the disciplines certain disciplines are considered more dangerous and thus have a stricter adherance to. Violation of the Code of Thankar could result in the severing of a disciple's connection to the mental disciplines altogether thus leaving them unable to perform even the most basic of mental feats. There are five basic mental disciplines within the mental disciplines.

Students of this school are known as Disciples of Thankar. To get into this school one must be a Tri Tosian by blood or show some talent in one of the disciplines. Although non-Tri Tosian Disciples are rare they do exist and are required to take the vow of the Code of Thankar and be bound by it for life.

**Kenetic**

The Kenetic Discipline is the discipline of motion for novices this entails moving of simple light weight and solid objects, giving a person a shove, etc. As they grow more experienced the objects can get larger and heavier and more than one object can be affected. 

Adepts of this discipline can begin to cause things to move on a molecular level, they can move small volumes water and gases and can cause flammible objects to spontaneously combust. This can be used to suff out a small fire or blow the dust off an object from a distance, ignite a candle or cause small volumes of liquid to evaporate mor quickly.

Experts of this discipline are truly dangerous and are bound to strict adherence to the Code of Thankar as they can quite literally as if my magic summon a fireball from thin air and hurl it at someone or move incredibly large objects or volumes of water. 

**Synaptic**

This discipline requires strict asherance to the Code of Thankar and any violation will result in severing of the desciples connection to the mental disciplines, there may even be legal ramifications as well. This discipline is similar to Star Treks Vulcan mind meld and requires physical contact, the subject need not be a disciple but it does make it safer for both parties if they are both disciples.

Novices can probe any willing subject for their thoughts or memories or use it as a means of private communication between each other. Note a level one Novice can only meld with another disciple, level two Novice can meld with non-disciples but only of their species. All Novices can only meld with one person at a time.

Adepts are much stronger than Novices in that they can meld with two persons at the same time but at least one of them must be a disciple and the other non-diciple must be of the same species. Level two adepts can begin to insert thoughts to willing subjects to give them more confidence or assist in the understanding of certain concepts. Level three Adepts are able to insert memories or erase memories. Level four Adepts can begin to forcibly meld with others, even non-disciples but this is strictly controlled and reserved for exceptional circumstances. They can also begin to repair psychic damage and assist with the mentally disturbed.

Experts in the synaptic discipline are excellent psycho therapist and mental health doctors and are often employed as such. They can revive a catatonic person, in most cases and even bring a person back from the edge of insanity. They can even transfer an entire learned skill from one person to the next but this is rarely done since the technology to achieve this fear is readily available within the Tri Tosian Empire. Expert disciples also posess the ability to sever a disciple's connection to the mental disciplines.

**Telepathic**

Disciples of this discipline are able to communicate with one another over a distance and even allows for the reading of surface thoughts and emotions of others even non-disciples. This can; however, be blocked by anyone of sufficiant will and naturally by some species. This discipline is most the most commonly studied discipline amongst Tri Tosians as it is usually the one that presents is self naturally shortly after birth. Most Tri Tosian Mothers have a natual telepathic link with their children that is seldom ever broken. Twin siblings, though rare among Tri Tosians, are likely to also have a natural telepathic link that is never broken except if one sibling is forcibly severed for violation of the Code of Thankar, but even then the link is not truly broken.

Novices can communicate with any telepath within a short distance, usually a mile or so, but the link they share with their birth mother or sibing is not bound by distance in theory. Two way communication is theoretically possible even if they are on separate planets, but in practice this is usually limited to simply knowing if one or the other is safe or in peril. Level two Novices can communicate at a greater distance of upto five miles and even begin to project their thoughts to non-telepaths but only if they are in the same room or line of sight upto 100 yards. The distance that two telepaths can communicate doubles for each Novice level after level two. But the non-telepath limitation remains throughout the Novice levels.

Adepts can communicate with any telepath within 50 miles and doubles each level. They can project their thoughts to a non-telepath within a mile of their position and if the non-telepath is witin 100 yards they can even read their reply. Blocking out a telepath's ability to surface thoughts and emotions becomes harder but still impossible for them to read those species that do it naturally. An adept who is also a disciple of the synaptic discipline and at least as competent can begin to link with other telepaths without physically touching them but is limited to no more than 30 feet.

Expert telepaths can communicate with any telepath on the same planet they are on with easy and can even boost the other telepath's ability so they can reply if their are not an expert as well. They can do the same with non-telepaths but the distance is limited to within 100 miles. Interplanetary communication with two expert telepaths have been known to occur but is exceedingly rare. And expert telepaths who are also disciples of the synaptic discipline can also meld with other telepaths but must be within the same 30 feet. They are also able to plant suggestions to not telepaths with the same distance limit.

**Bio Molecular**

Disciples of this discipline are the psychic healers of the mental disciplines, while used primarily to enhance the natural regenerative abilities of their own bodies they can through laying on of hands heal others with this discipline. Albeit not nearly as well as the Avalonians who are the undisputed masters of Bio Molecular manipulation for healing.

Novices of level one can speed up their own natural regeneration by a factor of two or heal simple cuts, abraisions, stop minor pain in others. Level two's can speed up their regeneration by a factor of three and heal more serious cuts, slow the flow of blood in an massive wound, easy severe pain and heal minor broken bones. Level three increases the regeneration to factor 4, can mend compound fractures, stop the flow of blood to a major wound, ease all but the most agonizing of pain and seal a gash upto 5 inches long. Levels 4 and five increast the regeneratio factors by 5 and 6 respectively but offer no additional healing of others.

Adepts can regenerate 7 to 10 times faster respective to their level. Can mend any fracture without setting the fracture first,seal gaping wounds, stop the flow of blood, stop all pain, and aleviate symptoms of illness.

Experts can regenerate in mere seconds except for severed limbs which requires at least an hour or more. They can also revive the recently deceased just as easily as a Doctor can but without medical equipment. They can also slow the progression of contagious diseases and cure common ailments.

**ESP**

This is the catchall of the disciplines, anything not specifically covered in any of the other disciplines is covered here, it is the least studied of all the disciplines and there are no known experts with few adepts. Disciples of this discipline can predict future events but usually not more than a few minutes, astral project, use remote viewing or hearing, bi-locate. But this discipline does not allow for teleportation of any kind. The scope and accuracy of this discipline is not well studied and is commonly rejected as hocus pocus even among disciples of other diciplines.
