# Weapon Creation

Whether designing a new fantasy weapon, modifying an existing weapon, or adding a real world weapon not already listed in the weapons table there are a few factors to consider when doing so. Such as:
Is the weapon needed?
What are its strengths and weaknesses?
How rare is it? 
How much does it cost?
What kind of damage will it do?

**Damage**
Most weapons are going to rely on some sort of kinetic energy in order to inflict damage. For damage use Newton’s 2nd Law of motion Force = Mass times Acceleration (F =ma), that is mass in kilograms time acceleration in meter per second equals Force in newtons. For sanity’s sake it is best to round the answer to the nearest whole number and square it for the total damage.

Some conversion formulas:

- Grains to Kilograms: kg = gr/15432
- Fps to Mps: Mps = Fps * .3048

To calculate damage of a particular projectile D = (gr/15432) * (Fps * .3048), then round and square the result. 

**Energy Based Weapons**
Other civilizations will have varying weapons technology including energy based weapons. For the sake of simplicity in calculating damage for every 400 Joules of energy out put 1 point of damage occurs on a successful hit. A joule is equal to watts expended in one second so a 1.2 Kw laser burning for a on second duration would produce 1200 joules of energy thus inflict 3 points of damage, roughly. The math might be off a bit but 400 joules for every point of damage should work just fine.

By this standard an energy based weapon with an out put of 50KJ would potentially inflict 125 points of damage. For an average human that would be enough to vaporize him if he wasn’t wearing armor to protect him.
