# NewRPG
An open source table top role playing game.
I know the name sucks right now but give it time this is a work in progress. This RPG is Sci Fi RPG set in the 22nd Century, mankind has made it to the stars not long after the close call of nuclear anihilation in the year 2025. Their first interstellar trip to Proxima Centari led to first contact with an alien species known as the Avalonians. A benevolent race of beings known for their immense knowledge of xenobiology and healing capabilities. 

**Basic Concept**

That's just a quick back story to give the game some futuristic appeal I haven't had a lot of time to think on it yet. So I've kicked this idea around min my head for a while now and finally decided to start writting it down. I wanted a game that did not require a lot of different dice to play to get started. My goal was to keep the amount and type of dice needed to a minimum ideally just 6 sided dice but with my [Perception](https://github.com/ikeman32/NewRPG/blob/master/CoreRules/Perception.md) table certain perception checks would require a percentage roll requiring two 10 sided dice, but that might change if I can figure out a way to do it with just the 6 sided dice.

I also wanted a Science Fiction themed RPG instead of Fantasy to keep **Magic** out of the game, not that magic isn't cool it just that I felt that it doesn't fit into what I have in mind. But the other thing is that I wanted a game that was open sourced and could evolve though a community rather than a commercial enterprise.

**Donations**

This project is 100% open source so the amount of time that there is any active developement will depend upon many factors but if you so choose you may make a donation via Crypto Currency by going to the [Contributors](https://github.com/ikeman32/NewRPG/blob/master/Contributors.md) page and selected a contributor to donate to.

**Contributing**

To contribte to this project please clone this repository make your contributions then submit a pull request. Don't forget to add your name or handle and any other information you want to share including crypto wallets.

**Standards**
For now the only standard is the required use of Mark Down for development other standards such as styles and such will probably be set once(if) the community grows and the game gets to a point where it can be played/released. In General try to keep things simple unless you have mad skills that I don't posses and can really make things pop.

**To Do**:
At this point there are too many things to list here but here are a few:

- Come up with a real name
- Create a number of species
- Create and add Weapons
- Create and add Armor
- Create and add Equipment
- Develop rules and guide lines
- etc.

As you can see there is pretty much everything that needs to be done so if this RPG idea sounds interesting and you would like to contribute please by all means lend a helping hand.
